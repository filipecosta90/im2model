4) Paramter file formats


MSA is controled by at minimum one parameter file. The main parameter file
is a mandatory program option to be given on each call. The program will
terminate with an error, of the parameter file is not specified. The structure
and format of the main parameter file and optional secondary parameter files
are defined below.


DEFINITION OF THE MSA MAIN PARAMETER FILE

The parameter file is written as line based unformatted ascii or ansi table.
The file is separated by block tags: '[Microscope Parameters]' and 
'[Multislice Parameters]' these two block tags must appear, otherwise 
parameters will not be read in properly.


What follows this line is a commented example of an MSA parameter file:

The MSA main parameter file allows you to provide an additional parameter
file defining a series of STEM detectors to be used in the calculation of
STEM image intensity data. This file may further link to additional files
specifying the radial detector sensitivity.

DEFINITION OF THE DETECTOR PARAMETER FILE FORMAT:

Use a detector parameter file to define a series of detectors. The parameter
file is a text file consisting of 3 header lines followed by a variable
number of data lines defining each one detector.

If you define more than one detector, MSA will generate a series of output
files. A suffix string will be added according to the namestring parameter
specified. In case of only one detector definition, no detector suffix string
is added to the output file name. This applies also in the case that no detector
definition file is used.

Detector parameter file format used by msa v0.70b+
line 1:	PRMNAME: string = "[Detector Parameters]"
line 2: VERSION: long integer = 2016021801 (determines how data is read in)
line 3:	DETNUM: Integer = Number of detectors defined in the following lines.
line 4 - line 4+$DETNUM: DETDEF(R1,R2,A1,A2,C1,C2,DN,DS) = Detector definitions.

		Detector definitions (DETDEF) consist of 6 parameters
		 (Float,Float,Float,Float,Float,Float,String,String)
		 
			parameter 1: R1: inner detector radius theta-1 [mrad]
			parameter 2: R2: outer detector radius theta-2 [mrad]

DEFINITION OF DETECTOR RELATIVE RADIAL SENSITIVITY PROFILES

These file may be used to define the radial sensitivity profile of each
detector individually. The file name is specified in the detector parameter.
It is again a text file containing a header line followed by a list of values.

Detector radial relative sensitivity profile parameter files format
as used by MSA from version v0.70+ on:
line 1: HEADER: NRS, PT1 (Integer, Float)
                NRS = Number of radial sensitivity data following from line 2 on
                PT1 = Pixel number identifying the detector theta-1 location
line 2 - line (NRS+1): DATA : RS(NRS) (Float)
                RS(NRS) = a list of sensitivity data.

        The first data item of the list (RS(NRS) is associated to the center
        of the detector area.
        In order to make the calculation comparable to the experiment,
        scale the experiment with the average detector sensitivity as
        calculated from the whole active area. Then scale the detector
        radial sensitivity profile relaltive to the same value.
        The resulting relative radial profile should be given in this list.

5) Multislice calculation setup examples


Slices variants are selected randomly during every multislice calculation from
alternative frozen lattice (FL) configurations. This allows on the one hand to
average over different variations on one scan pixel, and on the otherhand to
applay different configurations from scan pixel to scan pixel.


EXAMPLE 1: FROZEN LATTICE CALCULATION WITH MULTIPLE CONFIGURATIONS, OBJECT IS
           FULLY PERIODIC ALONG Z.
- Slice file name: [SFN] = 'C:\Data\Simulation\STO\110\sli\slice'
- Number of distinguished slices in the fully periodic unit cell: [NOSD] = 2 -> slice IDs 0 and 1
- Number of frozen lattice alternatives: [NFLV] = 100, each of the 2 slice files contains 100 frozen lattice variants.
- Since the slice files can be large, please check the total ammount of required and available memory before running msa. Avoid memory swapping to disk, this will cause drastic performance losses.
- Total number of slices in the object: [NOS] = 40 (determines the object thickness = 20*(thickness of slice 1) + 20*(thickness of slice 2))
- slice ID sequence: 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 ... 0 1 (minimum [NOS] = 40 lines! in the parameter file)
-> For every multislice msa selects randomly from the available alternatives.
- applied slice 1,  ID=0: Variant 091
- applied slice 2,  ID=1: Variant 007
- applied slice 3,  ID=0: Variant 053
- applied slice 4,  ID=1: Variant 044
- applied slice 5,  ID=0: Variant 023
- applied slice 6,  ID=1: Variant 002
- applied slice 7,  ID=0: Variant 017
........
- applied slice 39, ID=0: Variant 038
- applied slice 40, ID=1: Variant 072
-> when the number of frozen lattice calculations per pixel [NCPP] is larger than one, the random selection multislice is repeated [NCPP]-times and the obtained [NCPP] results are averaged.
-> every scan pixel is calculated with a different frozen lattice configuration


EXAMPLE 2: FROZEN LATTICE CALCULATION WITH MULTIPLE CONFIGURATIONS,
           OBJECT NOT PERIODIC ALONG Z, e.g. a nanoparticle.
- Slice file name: [SFN] = 'C:\Data\Simulation\PTP\sli\slice'
- Number of distinguished slices in the fully periodic unit cell: [NOSD] = 50 -> slice IDs 0 ... 49
- Number of frozen lattice alternatives: [NFLV] = 10, each of the 50 slice files contains 10 frozen lattice variants.
- Since the slice files can be large, please check the total ammount of required and available memory before running msa. Avoid memory swapping to disk, this will cause drastic performance losses.
- Total number of slices in the object: [NOS] = 50
- slice ID sequence: 0 1 2 3 4 5 ... 49 (minimum [NOS] = 50 lines! in the parameter file)
-> For every multislice msa selects randomly from the available alternatives.
- applied slice 1,  ID=0: Variant 002
- applied slice 2,  ID=1: Variant 007
- applied slice 3,  ID=2: Variant 003
- applied slice 4,  ID=3: Variant 004
- applied slice 5,  ID=4: Variant 003
- applied slice 6,  ID=5: Variant 002
- applied slice 7,  ID=6: Variant 001
........
- applied slice 49, ID=48: Variant 008
- applied slice 50, ID=49: Variant 006
-> when the number of frozen lattice calculations per pixel [NCPP] is larger than one, the random selection multislice is repeated [NCPP]-times and the obtained [NCPP] results are averaged.
-> every scan pixel is calculated with a slightly different frozen lattice configuration


EXAMPLE 3: TEM SIMULATION OF A FULLY PERIODIC OBJECT WITHOUT FL CALCULATION
- supply slice data containing the periodic unit cell along x and y, apply Debye-Waller factors and absorption potentials during slice generation
- Integer factor to internally repeat supercell data in horizontal direction, x = 8
- Integer factor to internally repeat supercell data in vertical direction, y = 10
- Slice file name: [SFN] = 'C:\Data\Simulation\STO\110\sli\slitem'
- Number of distinguished slices in the fully periodic unit cell: [NOSD] = 2 -> slice IDs 0 and 1
- Number of frozen lattice alternatives: [NFLV] = 1 (actually no frozen lattice)
-> In total 2 slice files should be named as
- - Slice 1 , slice ID= 0: 'C:\Data\Simulation\STO\110\sli\slitem_001.sli'
- - Slice 2 , slice ID= 1: 'C:\Data\Simulation\STO\110\sli\slitem_002.sli'
-> These 2 files will be read in and the data is repeated 8 times along x and 10 times along y after loading.
- Total number of slices in the object: [NOS] = 80
- slice ID sequence: 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 ... 0 1 (minimum [NOS] = 80 lines! in the parameter file)
- use the /ctem flag to start with a plane incident wave
-> result is saved as wave function data in complex-64-bit

6) History of changes

170411: JB: Version 0.74b
- Changed propagator creation algorithm form 32-bit to 64-bit arithmetics.
170329: JB: Version 0.73b (bug fix)
- Corrected a mistake in the potential-to-phasegrating conversion.
170308: JB: Version 0.73b
- Allow projected potentials as data type in slice files. MSA will generate
  phase-gratings from the projected potentials. Absorption can be applied
  here as well using a new command-line option -abf <value>. Universal DWFs
  can be applied using the new command-line options -buni <value> or
  -uuni <value>, where <value> specifies Biso (nm^2) or Uiso (A^2),
  respectively.
160923: JB: Version 0.72b
- Corrected a mistake in the generation of tilted propagators for calculations
  with object mistilt. The hard aperture was shifting with the tilt vector.
160829: JB: Version 0.71b
- Implemented a routine, which creates folders before writing files
  when the folder doesn't exist.
  The routine "createfilefolder" is using ifort libraries, so take
  care to adopt the code when using other compilers.
160307, JB: Version 0.70b
- Modified and changed text output concerning the applied electron energy
  and wavelength and the consistency check with the loaded slice files.
160218, JB: Version 0.70b
- Implemented relative radial sensitivity profiles for annular detectors.
  The use of this option is controled by the detector parameter file. The
  format of the detector parameter file has been changed accordingly, see
  section 4.
150916, JB: Version 0.64b
- Implemented a variable wavelength input from the parameter file.
  Line 6 can now be either the wavelength in nm or the electron energy in keV.
  Values >1 will be interpreted as electron energy, values below as wavelength.
150602, JB: Version 0.64b
- Added an output option "/txtout" to save the result to a separate and new file,
  instead of inserting it into a complete STEM image. The output file name is
  as specified by the "-out" command-line option. This is a STEM only option.
  When using the "/txtout" option results are added to a text list with header.
  The form of this text output file is given below:
    number of detectors "ndet"
      list of detector names, one name per line
    number of export planes "nslc" (thickness)
      list of export planes, one index per line
    number of total scan pixels ("nx","ny") (in the image and not in this file)
    "1" indicating a new record
      scan pixel index (i,j) (1..nx,1..ny) (for this record)
      data, ((all export slices)*(all detectors)) items of intensity, one item per line
    "1" indicating another record coming with the same form as the previous one
      scan pixel index (i,j) (1..nx,1..ny) (for this record)
      data, ((all export slices)*(all detectors)) items of intensity, one item per line
    "0" indicating end of file.
  The list of intensity values loops first over all thicknesses (inner loop) and
  then over all detectors (outer loop)
150506, JB: --
- Changed the CR/LF handling in non-verbose and non-debug output mode.
  The STEM pixel message will not receive a line feed anymore.
150504, JB: --
- Removed a bug in the slice pre-checking.
150131, JB: --
- Modified the slice loading routine to support index suffixes beyond 999.
150128, JB: --
- Rebuild due to modification of shared code.
150115, JB: Version 0.63b
- Modified the tilted propagator used to simulate an object tilt, such that
  the zero beam no longer recieves a phase shift.
141210, JB: --
- Modified aperture functions in the probe generation module.
130410, JB: Version 0.62b
- Modified the detector definition by adding a detector file version number
  in the second line of the file. The changes to the detector definition
  format made under "130312, JB: Version 0.61b" were partially undone. The
  program supports again only annular detector segments and no rectangular or
  file-based detector definitions. The new detector parameter file format is
  indicated in section 4 above. Since version 0.61b was never released to the
  public, the respective format is not explained in section 4.
130312, JB: Version 0.61b
- Modified the output file number indication to support numbers beyond 999.
  The number of digits is 3 at minimum or at least large enough to support the
  largest output index. WARNING: This feature is currently not supported by the
  other tools which may be applied subsequently (wavimg v0.52-130110)
- Modified the detector definition by adding an additional switch parameter.
  The switch is used to select between different detector definition formats:
  1: Annular segment (as used before v0.61)
  2: Rectangular segment (defined by two diagonal corner points)
  3: Experimental detector data (defined by a detector shape image (possibly
     also #electrons used to acquire the image for later use with other
     experimental beam currents and dwell times ) )
  WARNING: FUNCTIONALITY NOT TESTED!
120414, JB: Version 0.60b
- Modified the console text output.
- Implemented the option to insert a wave function which is used for further
  scattering calculations from a given slice index on towards the exit plane. 
  (Preparation of inelastic scattering calculations)
- Modified the image convolution with a finite source size using direct
  convolution. The convolution supports now different source profiles triggered
  by the flag in the parameter file.
  0 = no convolution
  1 = Gaussian profile defined by 1/e-half width, up to 3*1/e-width
  2 = Cauchy (Lorentzian) profile defined by the HWHM parameter, up to 0.01
      relative amplitude = 10 HWHM.
  3 = Cylindrical profile defined by a cut-off radius r0 (smothed sigmoid) with
      0.01 relative width: (1-tanh((r-r0)/r0*100))/2 up to 1.5*r0.
  The convolution will be done in real-space with a normalized convolution
  kernel (integral = 1) and a circular aperture at the edge of the kernel.
120411, JB: Version 0.55b
- Added command-line option -sr <float value> to set the effective geometrical
  source profile with comman-line calls.
120309, JB: Version 0.54b
- Corrected a misconception in the beam scan positions.
- modified the open-file shared access specification to better compatibility
  with compiles for MacOS and Linux.
120224, JB: Version 0.53b
- Modified the wave function export. The program distinguishes now between STEM
  and CTEM mode for the export. In CTEM mode the wave function is stored to
  file after application of the fresnel propagator. In STEM mode the wave
  function is stored to file after application of the projected potential phase
  grating.
120131, JB: Version 0.52b
- Added decenter parameters for detectors when using a detector definition file
  (2 extra parameters).
111228, JB:
- Fixed a bug in the wave export naming when using CTEM mode.
111209, JB: Version 0.51b
- Reduced the aperture power threshold from 0.01 to 0.001 to reduce artifacts.
- Included the comand-line switch /gaussap to allow gaussian source profiles
  in STEM mode.
111108, JB: Version 0.50b
- Reorganized the export of wave functions for both, CTEM and STEM mode.
  Note that the wave function file naming was changed.
110924, JB: Version 0.45b
- Added beam tilt and object tilt command-line parameters.
110513, JB: Version 0.44b
- Modified the memory management for phase gratings: Support for individual
  variant numbers. Improved memory efficiency while loading.
110506, JB: Version 0.43b
- Added a function to export detector functions in form of binary raw data
  files. Command-line option /detimg.
- Minor Modification: Changed detector interval check to min <= x < max, from
  min <= x <= max.
- Text corrections and usage information updated.
- Added some routines to prepare sub-slicing functionality.
110406, JB: Version 0.42b
- Bug fixed, the warning for a currently not existing output file now displays
  the correct output file name.
- (Still not working) Tried to make the standard output compatible with
  Wine 1.2.2 for Mac OS.
110329, JB: Version 0.41b
- Added a string parameter to the detector definitions. The output file naming
  in case of multiple detector readouts is changed. The output files are now
  created in the following way:
  <output name>_<detector name>_t<readout slice>.<output extension>
110227, JB: Version 0.40b
- Added feature to support azimuthally separated detector segments. Detector
  parameter file format is changed. DO NOT USE OLD DETECTOR PARAMETER FILES! 
110209, JB: Version 0.39b
- Added the option to set the defocus via a command-line parameter
  [-foc <value in nm>], which overrides the value set in the parameter file.
101217, JB: --
- Backup wave export files name creation modified.
101209, JB: Version 0.38b
- Added support for extended slice file format, where one slice file can contain
  multiple (frozen lattice) variants of the slice data. This slice file format
  is also supported by the slice creation routines of the programs "celslc.exe"
  and "Dr. Probe.exe".
101123, JB: Version 0.37b
- Added slice file title string handling.
101112, JB: Version 0.36b
- With /bkwexp, wavefunctions at each slice will be exported now before the
  propagation, but after the application of the projected potential.
- With /bkwexp, also the incident wave function is saved to a file with file
  name = <name of output file>+"_000.wav".
101102, JB: Version 0.35b
- Added input parameter checks.
101029, JB: Version 0.35b
- Apodization of the spatial coherence convolution kernel.
- Moved the focus spread convolution parameters close to each other in the
  parameter file.
- Extended documentation (this file).
101025, JB: Version 0.34b
- Simplified command line options: missing output file option causes output to
  standard output file name.
- Simplified command line options: missing scan pixel number options cause full
  STEM image simulation.
101015, JB: Version 0.33b
- Bugfix, for exit plane wave function export.
- Bugfix, for multiple detector readout, power rescaling bug.
101013, JB: Version 0.33b
- Bugfix, for wave function export.
100914, JB: Version 0.32b
- Added multiple detector readout at periodic slice numbers. A new parameter 
  was added.
100908, JB: Version 0.31b
- Removed a bug in the max. detector angle check when using detector array
  definitions
- Removed a bug in output file generation.
100903, JB: Version 0.30b
- Massive changes of the msa parameter file format.
- Added evaluation of frozen lattice variant data.
- Slice data files are now specified by a slice file name <SFN> string.
  Example: <SFN>="C:\Data\Material\Slices\slc", Slice files will be searched
           with names <SFN>+"_###.sli" where ### is a three digit number
           identifying the indiviual slices in numbered order from entrance
           slice 001 to exit slice [NOSD]. 
100902, JB:
- Simplifyied the msa parameter file.
100901, JB: Version 0.24b
- Added additional detector definition file link to the parameter file.
  If the detector definition file is specified, the standard detector definition
  is not used, and the detectors defined in the detector definition file are
  used. MSA loops over the defined detectors and creates a series of output
  files. Annular detectors are defined by two diffraction angles as usual.
100831, JB: Version 0.23b
- Added exit plane wave export, command switch /epwexp.
100305, JB: Version 0.22b
- Moved slice memory from module MS to module MSP, slices are now saved in
  original size without repetitions, repetitions are done during the application
  of the phase grating, this change should reduce memory consumption in some
  cases.
100302, JB:
- Recompiled with parallelization turned OFF. MSA should use only one thread
  core on multithreaded systems.
100222, JB: Version 0.21b
- Added code for switching between default array ffts 2048, 4096, 8192.
100127, JB: Version 0.2b
- Added an option in module multislice for saving real-space backup waves after
  each slice, by a switch flag ON/OFF (0/1) and a name string for the output
  which will be extended by "_###.wav", where ### is a the three digit number of
  current slice. Remark: Last bk wave is free of image side aberrations.
100126, JB:
- Switched compiler option for Parallelization ON.
091119, JB:
- Added frame rotation, parameter file changed to include the rotation angle 
  after the vertical frame size parameter.
- Added object tilt parameters after global sampling parameters.
